🎯 Objective
Be the first player to reach 100 points by rolling a die and accumulating scores—without getting too greedy!

🎲 What You Need
- One six-sided die (or two for variations)
- Paper and pen to keep score
- 2 or more players
🕹️ How to Play (Single Die Version)
- Player 1 rolls the die:
- If they roll 2–6, they add that number to their turn total.
- They can choose to roll again or hold.
- If they hold, the turn total is added to their overall score.
- If they roll a 1, they lose all points for that turn and their turn ends.
- Next player takes their turn, following the same rules.
- First player to reach 100 points wins!

🧠 Strategy Tip
The key is knowing when to stop. Keep rolling and you risk losing your turn’s points. Hold too early and you might fall behind. It’s a game of guts and timing!
